### **RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
Can we accurately predict player salary, all-star nominations, and other accomplishment features? Once completed, we plan to conduct a higher-level analysis of the current free-agent market and propose optimal moves for every team based on their position needs and cap availability. 

### **STEPS** 
1. Assess which players are undervalued/overvalued in order to build a new team and predict transfers.
2. Assess collegiate/international data for draft value.
3. Create a trade analysis model based on projected evaluated salaries + other evaluative metrics (Win Shares, DARKO, etc)
4. Create other models that predict other variables.
5. Conclude by assessing values of player archetypes and synergies of established archetype pairings
