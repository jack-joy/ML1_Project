2. Assess which players are undervalued/overvalued in order to build a new team and predict transfers.
3. Assess collegiate/international data for draft value.
4. Create a trade analysis model based on projected evaluated salaries + other evaluative metrics (Win Shares, DARKO, etc)
5. Assess values of player archetypes and synergies of established archetype pairings
